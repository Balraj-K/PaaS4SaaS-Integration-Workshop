### **STEP 2**: Create an Expense report using a receipt
-   One other way to create an expense report in a Digital Assistant is to upload an image of a receipt. The Digital Assistant uses key words scanned from the image to fill in the expense fields.

-   Download [sample receipt](./files/receipt.jpg)

-   **Upload** the image by selecting the icon to the left of the chat box and navigate to where you downloaded the sample receipt and **upload**.

![](./images/da9.jpg " ")

-   To change the date of the last expense submitted, type in **modify the last expense**

-   Type in **Change date to last tuesday**. The Digital Assistant recognizes the correct date through natural language processing, then saves the change, and automatically submits the new expense.  

![](./images/da10.jpg " ")

-   Confirm by entering the **confirmation code** in the last message sent from the Digital Assistant.
