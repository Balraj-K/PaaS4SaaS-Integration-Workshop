## Introduction

This lab will walk you through OAX and we will be analyzing financial data from your Fusion ERP data. The ERP data has already been pre-configured to be in your OAX environment, and will require you to understand how the out-of-the-box visualizations and metrics help the Finance Manager figure out ways to better the company’s accounts payable ratio.
